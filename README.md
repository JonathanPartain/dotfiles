# Dotfiles

Make sure that the following is installed:
  * oh-my-zsh (make sure to set the correct shell as well)
  * stow
  * i3
  * polybar
  * vim awesome configuration (https://github.com/amix/vimrc)
  
Clone the directory into `~/dotfiles`

Move all configuration files into a temporary directory as a security measure. Alternatively, run `move-old-config.sh` inside `~/dotfiles/scripts/.scripts` directory

Run `sync-dots.sh` inside `~/dotfiles/scripts/.scripts` directory

All should be ok!
